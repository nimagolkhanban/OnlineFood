In this project, I developed a versatile platform tailored for two distinct user roles: Restaurant and Customer. Through custom user configurations, I equipped each role with specialized features to enhance their respective experiences.
For Restaurant Users:
Menu Builder: Enables the creation and customization of the restaurant's menu.
Opening Hour Management: Allows restaurants to set and edit their operating hours effortlessly.
Cart & Order System: Facilitates the seamless management of customers' orders, from placement to processing.
Password Recovery & Reset: Provides secure methods for password recovery and reset, ensuring operational security.
Custom Email Templates and Order Details: Delivers personalized emails for various interactions and displays detailed order information for efficient management.
For Customer Users:
Cart System: Empowers customers to add and manage items in their shopping cart.
Valet Service: Offers an added convenience for customers seeking premium services.
User Profile: Allows customers to manage their profiles and track their orders effectively.
Orders & Order Details: Enables customers to place orders and view their details for a smooth experience.
Password Recovery & Reset: Ensures customers can easily recover or reset their passwords with minimal hassle.
Custom Email Templates: Enhances the communication experience with personalized email notifications.
I personally deployed the entire system on Liara, ensuring a reliable and scalable solution for both restaurant owners and their customers. The codebase is meticulously documented and publicly accessible on GitHub, highlighting the extensive development work involved in bringing this project to fruition.
This project showcases my capability to single-handedly design and deploy sophisticated web applications tailored to meet the needs of diverse user groups, demonstrating both technical proficiency and a user-centric approach to web development.
